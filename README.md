# React-Admin

Quick react starter for admin apps with [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui). This project was
bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
- [Firebase CLI](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools)

## Development

### Installing

```
yarn install
```

### Running the app locally

```
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br> You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

```
yarn deploy
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br> It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the
build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
